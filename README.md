# octocloud-templates

This repo contains examples of how to create production-grade endpoints for Machine Learning models using the Octo Cloud.
- In the `flan-t5-small` directory, you'll find an example of how to containerize a Hugging Face `transformers` model and deploy that on the OctoAI service.
- In the `diffusers-prompthero` directory, you'll find an example of how to containerize a Hugging Face `diffusers` model and deploy that on the OctoAI service.

A step-by-step explanation of the code and the containerization process can be found in this [tutorial](https://docs.octoai.cloud/docs/create-custom-endpoints-from-python-code) in OctoAI's docs.
